This is The Odin Project's Landing Page project to work on flexbox and other css styling.
Tools that will be used are basic HTML and basic css.  

Self reflection(After the project):
Grinded this out in three hours.  I spent the past few days completely confused when it came to flexbox and for some reason it stuck on today.
I was able to do all the css flexbox challenges pretty quickly and decided to do this project.
I was going to just copy the outline, but decided to put some effort into it and made a fun doggy page.  

When it comes to the tools used,  I did pretty much everything without neededing to look it up.  Which was only possible due to my past few days of struggle.
The hover addition I did at the end was the only thing I looked up and I was very happy with how everything came out.  Obviously some changes can be made and some optimization
can be done.  But for now I will move onto Javascript.
